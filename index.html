                  <h2>Tour stop one: Kansas City, MO</h2>
                  <p>Kansas city is the easiest, quickest trip to take besides chicago. its three hours, straight shot down 70 east. While in kansas city i stopped by a hookah bar for great vibes, drinks, and a fun time. For eating, i went to this concert to see my friend perform and thats always a good time as well! </p>

               <p>Houston was by far one of the most fun trips I've been on. Houston is filled with nothing but vibes, fun, things to do, places to see. Despite it being cold, I had the time of my life. I can't wait to visit again and get to experience more of what Texas has to offer!!</p>

               <p>This was my second time experiencing vegas and I love it more each time. From the strip, to the casinos, to the resturants, just everything about vegas. I plan on making that a once or twice a year trip. My favorite part of vegas is probably this drinks spot called "Fat Tuesday". The slushy drinks are amazing and they do what needs to be done if you know what I mean. </p>
